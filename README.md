## 🛠 How to Add a New Post

1. Create a file in `content/posts/` with a `.mdx` extension.
2. At the top, export your metadata:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: "Your Post Title",
  publishDate: "2025-04-14",
  description: "A short summary of the post.",
};
```

3. Write your content using markdown and React components!
